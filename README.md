# Damegue - dengue checker

Damegue is a dengue checker website which determines your chances of having dengue, based on your answers to the questions.
In addition, it checks for dengue clusters near you (available only in Singapore).

This program is developed by [Meng Shin](https://github.com/LimMengShin), [Ping Jin](https://github.com/minholly1993) and [Ysabelle Wong](https://github.com/ysabelle2006) for our 2022 Secondary 4 Computing+ Coursework.
