    <h2>How this dengue checker works</h2>
    <p>Firstly, based on the answers you input, the website calculates your chance of having dengue. Each question has a different weightage and will affect your chance of having dengue accordingly.</p>
    <p>Afterwards, the website gets the current location of your device. It will also retrieve the latest dengue clusters using an Application Programming Interface (API) from National Environment Agency (NEA).</p>
    <p>The website will then check for the distance between the dengue clusters and your location. If one of the dengue clusters is less than 200 metres from your location, it is considered that you are near a dengue cluster.</p>
    <p>Depending on how many dengue clusters are near you, your chance of having dengue will be increased accordingly.</p>
